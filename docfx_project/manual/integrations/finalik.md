# Final IK

- Extract the integration package from /HurricaneVR/Framework/Integrations/FinalIk_Integration.unitypackage
- To test the posing system with the included pilot prefab, open the HVRSettings and toggle on Inverse Kinematics and add the PilotPoser prefab to the Full Body field. This lets the posing system know to not use the individual hand prefabs, and to use the full body VRIK setup instead.
